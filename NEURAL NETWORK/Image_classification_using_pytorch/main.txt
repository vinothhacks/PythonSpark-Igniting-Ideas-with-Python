Description:
This repository contains the code for building and training a deep learning model to classify flowers using PyTorch. The model is implemented using a simple neural network architecture and trained on the Flowers Classification dataset. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of training and validation curves.

Key Features:
Implementation of a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch
Data preprocessing and transformation using torchvision.transforms
Custom dataset class for loading and preprocessing the Flowers Classification dataset
Training and evaluation of the model using DataLoader and CrossEntropyLoss
Visualizations of training and validation curves using Matplotlib
Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
